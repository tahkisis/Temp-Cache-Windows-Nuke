# Temp-Cache-Windows-Nuke
Clear all cache and temp files from all users.
The script works out of the box and if you want to add additional fields do so at your own risk.
You will need to run this as administrator to clear most of it.
This has been test as is with no issues to report modify it at your own and I take 0 responsonsibility for any implied or direct damages.
